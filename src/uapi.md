# Userspace API for using a GPU

## IP blocks
A gpu is split into multiple types of units responsible for different tasks.
For example:
- gfx for graphics pipeline,
- comp for compute
- vcn_dec for video decoding
- vcn_enc for video encoding
- sdma for memory transfers as far as I can tell

## Fat binaries
An executable can be **fat**, which means it contains bytecode for multiple target platforms
in one executable.

## Common usability scenarios

### How can I run RDNA assembly on a gpu?

### How to view RDNA instructions generated by a compiler?

### How to convert raw binary into RDNA assembly?
